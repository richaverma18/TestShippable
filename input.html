<!--  input box for URL and a submit button, call a REST API or a servlet using JSP to display a table

when user sends the URL, I can get the http page, turn it into a URL and then get the data as HTML, then use JTidy to scrap data from HTML. 
useful for reading HTML tags, maybe i can use it for classes. not sure though.
